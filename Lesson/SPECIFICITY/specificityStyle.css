/* Specificity is calculated on the basis of given pattern below */
/* inline style attribute > id selector > class selector > element selector */
/*  Element aka tags => div, head, ul, a, ......and so on  */

div#container ul.my-songs li{
    color: brown;
    background-color: yellow;
}

/* How to calculate specificity?

    -through 4 numbers  _, _, _, _
    - calculating the above css 0, 1, 1, 3 => 113 hence the above css has 113 specificity
*/

/* lets see another example */
/*  here we try the same design with different css selector/styles */

.favorite{
    color: yellow;
    background-color: brown;
}

/* This one doesn't work because it has less specificity as compared to above css styles
    Let's calculate - 0, 0, 1, 0 - because there is only one class selector
    => Since it has less specificity, this css doesn't work over above css
*/

/* Now let's look at another example with higher specificity */
div#container ul.my-songs li.favorite{
    color: pink;
    background-color: green;
}

/* Now this one will work because it has higher specificity than the above one*/
